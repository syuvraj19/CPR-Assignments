# ðŸ’» CPR101 - Computer Principles for Programmers

Welcome to the repository for CPR101 - Computer Principles for Programmers, a course I'm currently taking at Seneca College in Fall 2024. This course is designed to equip programmers with essential knowledge, skills, and techniques for mastering modern computer systems. 

## ðŸš€ Course Overview
In this course, we explore how computer systems handle process control, multitasking, virtualization, file storage, and network communications. We'll delve into essential hardware and device concepts, operating system usage, and interaction. Additionally, we'll cover programmer-specific tools like version control, project management, and the software development process.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, I aim to:
1. **Understand System Interactions**: Describe the interaction among hardware, system software, and application software, preparing for computer programming tasks.
2. **Perform Computer Tasks**: Accurately perform a range of computer interaction tasks using both graphical and command-driven interfaces.
3. **Define OS Functions**: Clearly define the functions and services in modern operating systems to make informed decisions in computing and programming.
4. **Integrate Technologies**: Complete tasks that integrate internet, virtualization, and cloud computing to enhance network-attached devices.
5. **Develop Skills & Techniques**: Assemble a collection of skills, techniques, and best practices for effective software development.
6. **Utilize Version Control**: Demonstrate how version control and project management techniques improve productivity and work quality in programming.
